Iâ€™m quite an early bird, so came into the office pretty early, embracing the sunshine with my love-heart shaped sunglasses on and a skip in my step. Of course that meant I would arrive at the same time as the CEO, who held the door open for me, just after I swiftly removed my sunglasses.

It was the second time Iâ€™d seen Frank in person. I found it kind of strange (in a good way) â€“ like meeting a celebrity.

When I started at the company, I was flown straight into a rush of celebrations as the company had IPOâ€™d, and seen Frank on Wall Street ringing the bell to declare Anaplan stocks open to the public! In terms of starting dates, Iâ€™d got my job at an amazing time!

Beginning my first job at the tail end of my studies, I ended up taking what Iâ€™d seen in films and TV shows, as to what a CEO would be like- kind of wisened and stoic, with barely any time left to talk to employees. During his first visit, I was surprised to see him just being a part of the office, and answering all kinds of questions with a great big smile and us all actually having a laugh. He clearly wasnâ€™t this intimidating figure my imagination had made him out to be!

Anyway, getting back to my sunny Friday morning. The previous day, my Team Leader had told us that the meeting would be us engineers and Frank, none of the senior members of the company, as he wanted us to freely voice our honest thoughts and opinions. I found this to be a really nice idea â€“ and spent the rest of the evening thinking of what I would say, if I managed to conjure the courage to speak to him.

Our company is rapidly growing, so space is becoming a bit of an issue with the volume of new hires coming in at all ends of the company. One of the things Iâ€™d noticed was that the space we do have, is often not utilised. Smaller parties would be booking out bigger meeting rooms when smaller were available, for example.

Before the meeting, my team had collated the ideas we had for the session, and I decided I would do my best to talk about the issue surrounding space. As more and more questions were asked, and my heart quickened with pre-emptive embarrassment; I finally talked my brain into raising a hand and talked about itâ€¦

â€¦low and behold, Frank smiled and wrote my idea on the board alongside the rest. My question hadnâ€™t sounded silly, my status as an Intern didnâ€™t hold any weight! I am an employee with valued thoughts and opinions.

I smiled, proud at myself, and it left me feeling great for the rest of the day. I felt empowered, and like telling people â€˜Just do it!â€™ in the fashion of Shia Labeouf.

I talk about this now, just over a week later, as today I had a review of my progress, and this was one of the areas in which I had impressed. Reflecting, I think this is a great, positive aspect for a company. An approachable CEO, and being noticed for adding to a discussion. ðŸ™‚
