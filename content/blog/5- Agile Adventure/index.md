Just before the bank holiday I was told I would be moving teams. The particular team I have moved to use a lot of Kotlin. A language, for those that don’t know, which is designed to fully incorporate with Java. Also, a language I have so far here, neglected almost entirely, and focused much more on JavaScript and React.

Overall, I felt very overwhelmed to be suddenly saying farewell to my team, as well as my precious component I had been working on for some time now. Reflecting, I decided in order to be Agile, I should take this in my stride.

I wouldn’t say I am adverse to change, just more like it often takes me quite a lot of time to get accustomed to asking new people for help and them not really knowing what I know. Also, a little while for the voice in my head to stop believing they think I’m totally useless.

My first week on the team, I felt like I was back at the start and didn’t know anything, and therefore felt I couldn’t be useful.

Now half way through my second week – after having my one-to-one with my new team leader, and discussed meeting with him a few times a week to talk about new technologies and ask questions- I have started to feel more positive!

Though, my one fear is that now I won’t be using JavaScript, React & Redux with the same velocity as before, and instead will be using most of my energy learning Kotlin – will I forget bits of what I have learnt, that make me a valuable employee?
