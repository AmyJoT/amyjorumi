![Hello World](./hello.jpg.webp)

My name is Amy Jo, and I live in York UK. I work at Anaplan as a Junior Software Engineer, currently on a year placement. I absolutely love my job, and my team, even though it can be challenging (but it wouldn’t be so fun if it wasn’t!).

I’m starting to write this blog as I’m learning new things all the time, and kind of learning more about the way I learn (at almost age 24!), which tends to be trying my best to absorb information, then explaining all the pieces to someone until it clicks. Now that someone could be you, friendly blog gremlins!

My ultimate goal is that the blog could be a resource for me, as well any internet venturers who happen to pass by.
